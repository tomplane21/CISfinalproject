Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I did the first two cross-examinations, as well as all the dialogue before and in-between them.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

The third and final cross-examination, as well as the last parts of dialogue. Depending on time, I may add images and music.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I have tried to add images in the past, but the way Ren'Py uses image uploading is a bit finicky. 
The in-engine resize tool doesn't seem to affect the images in-game, and it is hard to find transparent images of the right size.
