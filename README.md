## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

My current idea is to create a text-based version of the first trial in Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney. 
This is kind of similar to a text-based adventure game, except instead of choosing different paths, the player interaction will come from cross-examinations where they will
choose evidence to pick out holes in witness testimonies.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I am not planning to collaborate with classmates.

## Do you have any questions of your own?

How much code needs to be taken from a source that would require me to cite it?


# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

The First Turnabout: Python Edition

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A text-based version of the first trial from Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The software with go through the first trial of Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney, called The First Turnabout. The trial is split up into two major sections. The first section is mainly just dialogue between characters, with minimal player choice aside from some small decisions. The first section is the main "game" portion, the cross-examinations. Here, witness testimonies will be played, and for each statement of the testamony, the player will be given the option to either press the witness or present evidence. If they press, more information about that statement will be given. When the player finds a contradiction in the testamony, they can present evidence against the witness to end the cross-examination and continue the trial. But if they present incorrect evidence (or evidence on the wrong statement), they will lose one credibility point. The trial ends when the true culprit is brought to justice or if the player loses 5 credibility points. Currently, I am planning on using Ren'Py to execute this. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

I am not planning to combine this with another final project.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

I am not planning on collaborating with other classmates.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

The cross-examinations, where you present evidence on the right statements of witness testimonies.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The entire trial, including all dialogue and cross-examinations.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The entire trial plus character portraits and audio.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My immediate next step is to get used to and research Ren'Py and the features that it has. I will also need to learn how to impliment typical Python code (if/then statements, loops, etc) with Ren'Py's engine.
