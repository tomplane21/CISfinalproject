## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

My current idea is to create a text-based version of the first trial in Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney. 
This is kind of similar to a text-based adventure game, except instead of choosing different paths, the player interaction will come from cross-examinations where they will
choose evidence to pick out holes in witness testimonies.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I am not planning to collaborate with classmates.

## Do you have any questions of your own?

How much code needs to be taken from a source that would require me to cite it?
